## Project Proposal

LabFlow API supports lab mangement operations for administrators, professors, students, and guests by providing various features such as room reservation system, equipment tracking, scheduling, budget and expense tracking, logging research outputs, etc. It allows for user registration with different levels of access. Additionally, students can propose experiments and check if labs and equipment are available. Overall, this system aims to improve the efficiency of lab management and support everyone involved.
